Lo' Harry,

It's me Hagrid. Something weird is going on at Hogwarts. Meet me at Diagon
Alley ASAP!

Just in case you forgot, here's some useful spells!

- `ls`
    - Lumos (show contents of a directory)

- `cd ./${FOLDER_NAME}`
    - Change Doors (go into a directory)

- `cd /${FOLDER_PATH}`
    - Apparate (go directly to place)

Once you've practiced your spells, apparate to where I am (`/diagon_alley`).

Sincerely yours,
Rubeus Hagrid
