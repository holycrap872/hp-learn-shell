To kill this monster, you need to use a secret spell. Unfortunately, the exact
spell you need has been encoded using a **caesar cipher**. This means that the
letters of spell have been rotated.

For example, rotating the word "hello", rotation the word X times results in:

```
0: "hello"
1: "ifmmp"
2: "jgnnq"
3: "khoor"
...
26: "hello"
```

Use the `rotate` spell to decode the message below and slay the monster:

```
Kyv jgvcc kyrk pfl evvu kf ivdfmv kyv dfejkvi zj id
```

Hint: The first letter of the message is a "T"
