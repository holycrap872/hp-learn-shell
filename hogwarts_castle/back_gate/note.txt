# Background

To kill this monster, you need to use a secret spell. Unfortunately, the spell
you need has been encoded using a **caesar cipher**. This means that the letters
of the spell have been rotated to make them hard to read.

## Explanation

The `rotate` spell can help you quickly "undo" the cipher. For example, assume
you know the word "khoor" was rotated. To solve it, you could try different
numbers of rotations as seen below:

```
rotate -n 0 "ebiil"     ->     "ebiil"
rotate -n 1 "ebiil"     ->     "fcjjm"
rotate -n 2 "ebiil"     ->     "gdkkn"
rotate -n 3 "ebiil"     ->     "hello"
```

Look at that! It looks like "ebiil" is "hello" rotated!!!

## Specifics

Use the `rotate` spell to decode the message below and slay the monster:

```
Ocz nkzgg amjh ocz nkzgg wjjf ocvo tjp izzy oj mzhjqz ocz hjinozm dn mh
```

Hint: The first letter of the message is a "T". How many times do you have to
   "rotate" and "O" to get to a "T"?
